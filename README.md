# MATLAB EXPO 2024

Repository created as supporting material for the presentation titled *"Developing Powerful GUIs in MATLAB for Spectrum Monitoring: An ANATEL Case Study."*

After cloning the repository, the "miniSupportPackages" subfolder must be mapped in MATLAB.

List of examples:
- Example 1 – TabGroup Selection and JS Customization
- Example 2 – Credential Modal Dialog
- Example 3 – WordCloud
- Example 4 – Google-Like Search Field
- Example 5 – Multiwindow Docked-Style App

Additionally, below are the links to the repositories for the presented applications: appAnalise, appColeta, and SCH.
- appAnalise: https://github.com/EricMagalhaesDelgado/appAnalise
- appColeta: https://github.com/EricMagalhaesDelgado/appColetaV2
- SCH: https://github.com/InovaFiscaliza/SCH

All three apps depend on the same package: https://github.com/InovaFiscaliza/SupportPackages

If you want to run one of these apps, you need to clone the repositories — not just the app itself, but also the one that supports them — and add the local folder of the "SupportPackages" repository to your MATLAB path. Before running the app, make sure to open the project.
